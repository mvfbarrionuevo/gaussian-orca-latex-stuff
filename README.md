# Gaussian, Orca and LaTeX stuff

Herein you are going to find some scripts I have been using to deal with Gaussian computations and Fukui index calculations by multi-job Orca computations with Janpa package. There are also other raw scripts to help compile, and check spelling mistakes on LaTeX stuff.

I am not a professional programmer; therefore, do not expect to find here state of the art. I am just a humble student who believes that small things matters. Also, English is my second language, and I would like to apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes.

Overall, I feel my work worths to be shared and hope to fit someone's needs. If it helped you somehow, so please make yourself as comfortable as you can to help to improve it or spread it.

There is no need to cite my work, and I do not want it. However, I often use third-party packages such as Gaussian, Orca, Janpa, PyMol, AutoDock. Hence, I hope you can cite these third-party packages.

That is it, please, be welcome and let us share whatever we can to help others.
