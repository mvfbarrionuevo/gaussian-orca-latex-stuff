# Gaussian, Orca and LaTeX stuff

Herein you are going to find some scripts that I have been using to deal with gaussian computations, fukui index calculations by multijob Orca computations with Janpa package. There are also other raw scripts to help compile and check spelling mistakes on LaTeX stuff.

I'm not a professional programmer, therefore, don't expect to find here the state of art. I'm just a humble student who believes that small thing matters. In addition, English is my second language and I would like to apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes.

Overall, I just feel my work worths to be shared and hope to fit to someone's needs. If it helped you somehow, so please make yourself as comfortable as you can to help to improve it or spread it.

There is no need to cite my work and I don't want it. However, I often use third party packages such as Gaussian, Orca, Janpa, PyMol, AutoDock. Hence, I hope you can cite these third party packages.

That's it, please, be welcome and let's share whatever we can to help others.
